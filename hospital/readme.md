## Business Problem  
Hospital administrators lack a unified view of **clinical**, **financial**, and **pharmacy operational KPIs** due to siloed data systems.  
This fragmentation leads to:  
- Delayed decision-making  
- Inefficient resource allocation  
- Reduced service quality  
- Limited ability to proactively monitor performance or forecast demand across hospital units  

---

## Business Objective  
- **Maximize:** Real-time operational visibility  
- **Minimize:** Decision-making delays  

---

## Business Constraints  
- **Maximize:** System interoperability requirements  
- **Minimize:** Data integration complexity  

---

## Success Criteria  
- **Business Success Criteria:**  
  - All 3 core departments (Clinical, Financial, Pharmacy) have functional dashboards with real-time KPI access  

- **Economic Success Criteria:**  
  - At least **30% reduction in manual reporting time**, translating to cost savings in administrative overhead  .

## Enhanced Analytics â€“ Hospital Data Sets

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Hospital administrators face challenges in decision-making due to fragmented data across clinical, financial, and operational systems.  
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data preprocessing** for key financial metrics, providing statistical insights and visualizations for better hospital resource monitoring.

## ðŸ“Š Columns Used
1. **total_spending** â€“ Total expenditure of hospital units.  
2. **total_quantity** â€“ Total quantity of resources/medicines utilized.  
3. **transaction_count** â€“ Number of transactions recorded.  
4. **revenue_lost** â€“ Estimated revenue lost due to inefficiencies.

**Insight:**  
The data shows a **right-skewed distribution** where most units spend around **6â€“10M**, but a few extreme outliers (34Mâ€“114M) raise the mean far above the median.

### **Second Business Moment (Dispersion)**
**total_spending**  
- Std. Dev = 36,997,121.14  
- Variance = 1.37e+15

### **Third Business Moment (Skewness)**
**total_spending**  
- Skewness = 1.87  

**Insight:**  
The skewness of **1.87** indicates a **strong right skew**, meaning a few very high spenders pull the distributionâ€™s tail to the right.

- **Skewness:** 1.89  

**Insights:**  
The strong positive skew indicates the presence of many low-to-moderate unit prices with a long tail of expensive items. This confirms that higher-priced products are inflating the mean.

- **Kurtosis:** 3.51  

**Insights:**  
The distribution is leptokurtic (kurtosis > 3), meaning it has heavier tails and more outliers than a normal distribution. This suggests frequent extreme pricing events.
